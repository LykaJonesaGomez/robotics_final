    <style: width: 50px; height: 50px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;>
        <p>Workforce Career Institute is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution focused on preparing individuals for careers in various industries. It offers a variety of programs aimed at developing specific skills and knowledge relevant to today’s workplace requirements. It further guarantees holistic services and support to its students from admission to graduation.</p>
        <p><em>✓ Career Mapping Sessions </em></p>
<p><em>✓ Dynamic and Collaborative Classroom Environment</em></p>
<p><em>✓ Mentoring and Coaching Sessions </em></p>
<p><em>✓ Career Support Programs </em></p>

<p> Workforce Career Institute is the Founder’s dream come true. It all started with an ardent desire to put up an education institution that would cater to the needs of Filipinos from 
career programs to graduate programs. </p>
<p> The pandemic changed the education landscape in the country. The pandemic left everyone unready and many got caught off-guard – many lost their jobs and had to look
    for ways to reskill, upskill and retool to cope with the global situation. All educational institutions were quick in their transition from delivering their programs in the face-toface setup to the online modality. It paved the way in the streamlining of the utilization of 
    existing technologies to effectively deliver courses and programs.</p>
<p>The situation had inspired the Founder, Dr. Peter Elmar Cahati-an Bordo, to put up an institution that serves as a platform to the continuous delivery of 
    pandemic-proof programs. To put this into reality, he mustered the members of his family to discuss his plans. He, then, immediately got their full support.
    Hence, the foundation of the institution on May 6, 2024.
<p> Now, Workforce Career Institute is serving its purpose to the Filipino people through the delivery of various VocTech, Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctoral
    programs which give hope to those who are enthusiastic in learning and in imbibing careerpreneurship spirit.</p>
